1. BGPSEC patch

This is a patch that adds BGPSEC capability to the BIRD BGP
implementation.

This patch is not well tested and only tested on Linux machines. It is
in an Alpha release and ***should not be considered for production
systems***.  The basic BGPSEC protocol is supported with a several
notable exceptions: IPv6 support, more than one signature block (for
algorithm rollover), and bugs we have not seen yet.

For information on BGPSEC see the Internet Engineering Task Force
(IETF) Secure Inter-Domain Routing (SIDR) working group page and
specifically the draft describing the BGPSEC protocol:

https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/sidr/
https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-sidr-bgpsec-protocol/

This patch is for v1.3.9 of the BIRD software.  The patch will likely
have some conflicts on different versions.  Information about BIRD
including download instructions can be found at:

General Instructions 

Building BGPSEC enabled bird

This describes building bird with BGPSEC support turned on, which
requires a few steps.  Contents

    2.1 Dependencies
        2.1.1 Use An OpenSSL version that supports ECDSA (Elliptic
              Curve Digital Signature Algorithm)
    2.2 Building Bird
        2.2.1 Configuring and Compiling
    2.3 Testing
    2.4 Using It
    2.5 Coding For It


2.1 Dependencies

On Fedora, you'll want flex, bison, and readline-devel packages.

2.1.1 Use an OpenSSL version that supports ECDSA (Elliptic Curve
      Digital Signature Algorithm)

The default OpenSSL distributed by many Linux vendors does not include
elliptic curve support.  If yours distribution does not support
elliptic curve in the OpenSSL libraries, you'll need to grab a fresh
copy and compile it by hand. You may want to install it in a location
separate from the normally installed package. Use the --prefix option
to do this:

 # ./config --prefix=/usr/local/openssl-ecdsa

Then make and make install

Note: Fedora (16,17) openssl RPMs and SRPM (17) with ecdsa support and
an openssl source tar ball are available at:

http://bgpsec.tislabs.com/openssl-ecdsa/



2.2 Building Bird

Configuring and Compiling

If you are using the patch, download BIRD bird-1.3.9.tar.gz from
http://bird.network.cz/

 # tar xvzpf bird-1.3.9.tar.gz 
 # cd bird-1.3.9/
 # patch -p1 < PATH-TO/BIRD-bgpsec-patch-v1.3.9.diff 


Build it.
First rebuild configure (configure.in was changed by the patch):

 # autoconf 

Then Use configure flags that look something like the following. In
particular the paths for -I/usr/local/openssl-ecdsa/include and
-L/usr/local/openssl-ecdsa/lib are necessary to compile if you have a
ecdsa supporting openssl installed in a non-standard location on your
platform.  The OpenSSL arguments will change and may not be necessary
depending on if you needed to install a ecdsa supporting openssl and
where you installed it:

 # ./configure '--enable-bgpsec' 'CFLAGS=-I/usr/local/openssl-ecdsa/include -g' 'LDFLAGS=-L/usr/local/openssl-ecdsa/lib/'

Then make and you should be good to go.


2.3 Using It

You can create key pairs using the proto/bgp/bgpsec/keytool.py
script.  For Example:

# proto/bgp/bgpsec/keytool.py --printski --public-key-dir /usr/share/bird/bgpsec-keys --private-key-dir /usr/share/bird/bgpsec-private-keys generate 'ASN'
 40C70252FE48D29401E9156ADBECF3EF42296AE4

Where ASN is the AS number for the key you are generating.

The generated public key is stored in '--public-key-dir' (default
/usr/share/bird/bgpsec-keys) and the private key is stored in
'--private-key-dir' (default /usr/share/bird/bgpsec-private-keys).
The file names are based on the AS number and the SKI value associated
with the keys, 'ASN.SKI#', e.g. for an ASN of 12345,
12345.40C70252FE48D29401E9156ADBECF3EF42296AE4.

The public key can be copied to other machines and placed in the same
public key directory without the private key. Likewise, keys from
other routers can be placed into the public key directory with their
ASN/SKI identifying the file names in order for the validation
routines to look them up.

NOTE: in the future, to use the -rtr protocol instead to pull router
keys.  The file names will also likely be part of a directory
structure as well (.e.g ASN/4-digit/2-digit/Rest-of-SKI).


2.4 Coding For It

The API for use in validating stuff can be found in
proto/bgp/bgpsec/validate.h. But most importantly, these two functions
will be of the most use:

 int bgpsec_sign_data_with_ski(...);
 int bgpsec_verify_signature_with_ski(...);

As they sign and verify data simply by passing the data along with a
SKI in ascii/hex form and a ASN integer (in reality, it's just the
filename from above so as long as it can be stored in a file name it's
usable).

The algorithm option should be set to
BGPSEC_ALGORITHM_SHA256_ECDSA_P_256 or BGPSEC_DEFAULT_CURVE.


3. BIRD run time configuration

The BGPSEC implementation currently has several additional
configuration options for the configuration file.  The following is an
example bgp section from a BIRD configuration file supporting BGPSEC:

  protocol bgp {
	 # AS4 is required for BGPSEC, this must be enabled
         enable as4;

	 # enable bgpsec for this connection
         bgpsec on;

	 # The local BIRD router subject key identifier (SKI) for this
         # connection.  'bgpsec_ski' identifies the (private) key that
         # the local BIRD router should use to sign BGPSEC packets on
         # this connection.
         bgpsec_ski "8CA56CF0A4D943ACCEB9CB67967561CA8A773B73" ;

	 # The local directory paths for the public router key and private
         # key storage. The defaults are below:

         bgpsec_key_repo_path "/usr/share/bird/bgpsec-keys/" ;
	 bgpsec_private_key_path "/usr/share/bird/bgpsec-private-keys" ;

	 # Do not allow the peer to set its pcount to 0.  Default is
         # true.  Set this value to false/0 if you want to allow your
         # peer to not have their AS included in the effective AS-PATH
         # lengths of a route (e.g. Route Servers).
         bgpsec_no_pcount0 1;

	 # non-bgpsec info
         description "BGP Link";
         local as 64521;

         neighbor 172.16.1.2 as 64522;
         gateway direct;
         
         path metric 1;         # prefer shorter paths
         default bgp_med 0;     # when none is available

         password "demonet";
  }


4. Getting RPKI-RTR data (ROA's and Router Keys)

BGPSEC-BIRD-client is a separate application that is provided in order
to pull data from a rpki-rtr using rtrLib.  It can garner Router
Origin Authorizations (ROAs) from a rpki-rtr and populate BIRD's ROA
tables in order to filter for Origin Authentication.  It can get
router public keys and place them in the local file system for use by
the BGPsec code.  Please see the README with that software for
instructions on how to use it.
